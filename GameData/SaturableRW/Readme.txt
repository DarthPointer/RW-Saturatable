==================================================

SaturableRW is a mod for Kerbal Space Program (KSP) that makes the stock reaction wheels (RWs) more realistic by adding momentum management.

Original KSP forum thread: https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?showtopic=100094

Features:

    • Reaction wheels accumulate momentum with use, torque output is modified based on the current stored momentum.
    • Stored momentum "magically" (i.e. no basis in real physics) slowly decays over time, recovering the parts torque capabilities. The rate is configurable in the part configuration files (i.e. you can turn it off, decrease the rate, or increase the rate to suit your play style).
    • Stored momentum can also be discharged at the expense of propellant (this feature is not enabled by default, you will have to change the file extension of the "SRW_ResourceDrain_Config" file from ".txt" to ".cfg" to enable it).

Installation:

    Extract the contents of the SaturableRW .zip file and then drop the SaturableRW folder into the GameData folder.
    Note: if you are upgrading then make sure that any previous SaturableRW installation has been completely removed beforehand.
