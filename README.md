# RW-Saturatable

This is the fork of (Semi-) Saturatable Reaction Wheels mod repo, started few years ago after the original author abandoned KSP modding. Here is the original thread https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/105289-*.

This fork goes directly from the original repository while there is a more updated fork "bound" to @HebaruSan which features some improvements I may add too.

In order to prevent chaos in version naming I have decided to mark the first version after "adoption" as 2.0.0. It does not really have any important changes apart from exception spam fix caused by installing one of the SETI mods.

The original repo licence file is pretty short, it is only two lines long. They tell us the mod is under GPL v3 license and the name of the original author. Let it be so then.
